## 🎯 Data Story & Key Narratives

### 📊 **The Numbers Tell a Story**
Our analysis reveals a stark reality: **2.38+ million crimes** against women were recorded from 2017-2021, with an average of **448 cases per district**. But behind these numbers lies a complex narrative of systemic issues, regional disparities, and alarming trends.

### 🔍 **Three Critical Insights**

#### 1. **The Geography of Violence** 🗺️
- **Uttar Pradesh dominates** with 14.59% of all crimes, followed by Maharashtra (9.27%) and Rajasthan (9.03%)
- These **top 3 states account for 33% of all crimes** despite representing 28% of India's population
- **Urban districts show 40% higher crime rates** than rural counterparts, indicating infrastructure and reporting accessibility impacts

#### 2. **The Hidden Crisis of Domestic Violence** 🏠
- **52.32% of all crimes are domestic violence cases** - more than half of all crimes happen within homes
- Kidnapping & Abduction follows at 38.09%, while rape cases constitute 5.83%
- **Strong correlation (0.78) between domestic violence and cruelty cases**, suggesting systemic household abuse patterns

#### 3. **The Disturbing Upward Trajectory** 📈
- **23% increase in reported crimes** from 2017 to 2021
- 2020 showed a temporary dip (likely due to COVID-19 lockdowns and reduced reporting)
- **Post-2020 spike of 35%** suggests either improved reporting mechanisms or actual increase in crimes
